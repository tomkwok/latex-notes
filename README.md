# LaTeX notes

This repository contains a non-exhaustive collection of my examples of my study notes typeset in LaTeX rendered in PDF format as introduced in [my blog post titled LaTeX notes](https://tomkwok.com/posts/latex-notes/).

`pdf2svgclean.sh` is my shell script (for Bourne-compatible shell) that wraps `pdf2svg` and `svgcleaner` to produce a separate SVG file for each page in a PDF file.

`comp2123_prog_tools.pdf` is converted to SVG format included as an example as follows.
